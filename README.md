# glitches

this is my own copy of the database of pulsar glitches maintained [**here**](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/glitches/gTable.html) by the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester. if you end up using the data from the original table or from this repository, please cite [**Espinoza et al. (2011)**](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.414.1679E) (a BibTeX style citation for the same is given in the **CITATION.md** file) and refer to the original [**url**](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/glitches.html). the data, in all of its JSON glory, is available in the **glitches.json** file. the whole scraping code resides in the **scrap.py** file. this repository will eventually power the **neko** package, which aims to make accessing all pulsar and radio transient related catalogues easier.
